## Local database

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the example password with a local value:

```sh
cp .env.example .env

```

Start PostgreSQL with:

```sh
docker compose up -d

```

### Testing the database

Once the container is running, you can verify the connection or interact with the database directly.

**Run a quick health check:**

```sh
docker exec -it python_local_pg pg_isready -U admin

```

**Open an interactive psql session:**

```sh
docker exec -it python_local_pg psql -U admin -d orm-db

```

*(Once inside, you can run `\dt` to list tables. Type `\q` to exit. Note: Replace `admin` and `orm-db` with your actual `.env` values if you modified them).*

**Connect from your host machine (if psql is installed locally):**

```sh
PGPASSWORD=admin psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U admin -d orm-db

```

### Stopping the database

Stop the database with:

```sh
docker compose down

```

`.env` is read automatically by Docker Compose and is ignored by Git. Do not commit it.

## GitHub Actions secrets

Add these repository secrets under **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret**:

* `POSTGRES_USER`
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
* `POSTGRES_DB`

GitHub Actions does not automatically pass repository secrets into Docker Compose. Expose them on the workflow step that runs Compose:

```yaml
- name: Start database
  run: docker compose up -d
  env:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_USER }}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_PASSWORD }}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_DB }}

```

Use `${{ secrets.NAME }}` only in workflow files. For pull requests from forks, GitHub does not provide repository secrets, so steps requiring these secrets should be skipped or use a separate non-secret test database configuration.

# ORMMM

**Lightweight ORM exercise for CPP50**

*Internal Engineering Spec*

*TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION*

**Mini-ORM: Building a Lightweight Object-Relational Mapper**

**Team size:** 2-3 engineers per group

**Target stack:** Python 3.12, PostgreSQL, psycopg2, pytest

**Deliverable:** A working mini-ORM library with test coverage, meeting the acceptance criteria in Section 7

---

## 1. Purpose

Build a lightweight Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) from scratch: a library that lets a developer declare a Python class with typed fields, and get automatic table creation, CRUD operations, relationship handling, and a chainable query API on top of a real PostgreSQL database, without hand-writing SQL for common operations.

This is the same category of problem as any production ORM (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Odoo's ORM…): fields behave as descriptors, models are collected into a central registry, and query results are returned as lazy, chainable collections rather than eagerly-fetched lists.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In scope

* Field declaration via descriptors (Char, Integer, Boolean at minimum)
* A metaclass-based model registry
* Schema generation (`CREATE TABLE`) and execution against PostgreSQL
* CRUD operations: create, write (update), search (select), unlink (delete)
* Relationships: Many2one, One2many, Many2many
* A chainable, lazy query API returning recordset-like objects
* Detection and resolution of an N+1 query pattern
* At least one computed field
* Test coverage (`pytest`) of the above, proportionate to time available

### 2.2 Out of scope

* A general-purpose SQL dialect or multi-database support
* Schema migrations
* Query plan optimization beyond the N+1 case explicitly required
* Authentication, authorization, or multi-tenant concerns
* A formal CI pipeline, tests should pass locally against a real PostgreSQL instance; CI wiring is not required

---

## 3. Suggested Order of Work

Build in whatever order works for your group but the dependency chain between pieces makes some orders far smoother than others. The order below is a suggestion, not a requirement:

1. **Foundation first:** one working Field descriptor, the metaclass registry, and `CREATE TABLE` generation for a single simple model. Nothing else can be built before this is solid, every relation type extends it directly.
2. **Many2one before One2many:** One2many is a reverse lookup that depends on a working Many2one existing on the other side. Build the forward relation first.
3. **Many2many after both of the above:** it reuses the same lazy-resolution idea as Many2one/One2many, plus a generated association table, easier once that pattern is already familiar.
4. **Query API (lazy, chainable RecordSet) once at least one relation type exists:** laziness is easiest to reason about once there's a real relation to defer loading on. Building the query counter/instrumentation here also sets up the next step.
5. **N+1 detection and fix last:** it requires the query counter, at least one relation type, and the RecordSet from steps above. This is the natural culmination of everything built before it.
6. **Computed field:** genuinely independent of the rest, safe to slot in wherever there's spare time, including as a final stretch item if the group is ahead of schedule.

Groups can build together on the foundation, then split sub-tasks within the group for a given step (e.g. one person on the descriptor while another wires up the schema generator for the same relation), but avoid starting a later step before the one it depends on is working end-to-end.

---

## 4. Team Structure

For a group of 2-3, strict per-person ownership of a whole relationship type for the entire project adds more coordination overhead than it saves. Instead, here is a suggestion to organize your work:

* Build the foundation (Section 3, step 1) together, it's the shared base everything else extends.
* From there, rotate who drives each step rather than assigning permanent ownership of a subsystem, e.g. one person drives Many2one, another drives One2many, then swap for Many2many.
* Within a 3-person group, sub-split inside a single step is fine (e.g. one person on the descriptor, another on schema generation for the same relation), avoid two people owning entirely separate subsystems in parallel without a working foundation.
* Short internal review before moving to the next step: don't build Many2many on top of a Many2one that hasn't been tested.

---

## 5. System Requirements

Requirements are tagged **MUST** (required for acceptance) or **SHOULD** (expected, but negotiable in scope/time).

### 5.1 Field Descriptors

* **MUST:** A base Field class implementing the descriptor protocol (`__get__`, `__set__`, `__set_name__`), storing values per-instance (not on the class).
* **MUST:** At least `CharField`, `IntegerField`, `BooleanField` subclasses, each mapping to an appropriate PostgreSQL column type.
* **SHOULD:** Basic validation on assignment (type coercion or a clear error on mismatch).

```python
class Field:
    def __set_name__(self, owner, name): ...
    def __get__(self, instance, owner): ...
    def __set__(self, instance, value): ...

class CharField(Field):
    sql_type = "VARCHAR"

```

### 5.2 Model Registry (Metaclass)

* **MUST:** A metaclass that, on class creation, collects all declared Field instances on a model and registers the model in a global registry keyed by model name.
* **MUST:** Registered models are discoverable at runtime (e.g. `registry.get('product')`).
* **SHOULD:** Table name derivation from the class name or an explicit `_table` attribute.

### 5.3 Schema Generation & CRUD

* **MUST:** Generate a valid `CREATE TABLE` statement from a model's declared fields and execute it against PostgreSQL.
* **MUST:** Implement `create()` (INSERT), `write()` (UPDATE), `search()` (SELECT), and `unlink()` (DELETE) as methods usable from application code.
* **SHOULD:** Parameterized queries throughout - no string-formatted SQL with user-supplied values.

### 5.4 Relations

* **MUST:** Many2one: a descriptor-backed field that stores a foreign key column and, on access, lazily loads and returns the related record (not just the raw id).
* **MUST:** One2many: a reverse accessor that, given a record, returns the set of related records pointing to it via a Many2one on the other model.
* **MUST:** Many2many: a generated association (junction) table, with an accessor returning the related recordset in both directions.
* **SHOULD:** Relation descriptors should not issue a query until the related data is accessed (lazy by default).

### 5.5 Query API

* **MUST:** `Model.search(domain)` returns a RecordSet-like object, not a plain list.
* **MUST:** The returned object supports chaining, e.g. `Model.search([...]).filtered(lambda r: ...)`.
* **MUST:** Iteration, `len()`, and `bool()` on a RecordSet only trigger the underlying query at the point they're evaluated (lazy evaluation), not at `search()` call time.
* **SHOULD:** Support combining or narrowing an existing recordset without re-querying from scratch where reasonably possible.

### 5.6 N+1 Detection & Resolution

* **MUST:** Construct a scenario where iterating over a recordset and accessing a Many2one (or One2many/Many2many) field per record issues one query per record (the N+1 pattern).
* **MUST:** Instrument query execution (a counter or logger) so the N+1 pattern is measurable, not just asserted.
* **MUST:** Implement a fix (batch/prefetch loading) and show the measured query count drop for the same scenario.

### 5.7 Computed Fields

* **MUST:** At least one field whose value is derived from other fields via a method rather than stored directly.
* **SHOULD:** A caching or invalidation strategy so the computed value isn't silently stale after a dependency changes.

### 5.8 Testing

* **MUST:** A small `pytest` suite covering, at minimum: the field descriptors, the model registry, and the N+1 detection/fix - the three pieces the acceptance criteria check.
* **SHOULD:** Additional coverage of relation types (Many2one/One2many/Many2many) as time allows.
* **SHOULD:** Tests run against a real (local) PostgreSQL instance rather than being fully mocked.

---

## 6. Working Agreement

* Keep the group working against one shared registry/schema layer, not parallel private versions of it.
* A quick informal review before moving to the next step in the suggested order (Section 3) is enough, no formal PR process is required for a group this size.

---
